# Protection Poker ![Publish Docker image](https://github.com/janniclas/protection-poker-backend/workflows/Publish%20Docker%20image/badge.svg)


This project is currently in a pre alpha state and is used by me as a playground, for first experiments. 

---
This is a basic implementation of a server used to host protection-poker games, which can be accessed by this [client application](https://github.com/janniclas/protection-poker).
